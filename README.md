# Library of Libraries ML@CL

The purpose of the Library of Libraries (LLs) platform is to create a repository of artefacts to demonstrate the outputs of the research projects at the ML@CL research group. The platform tenets are:

- LLs is domain and language agnostic.
- LLs focuses on artefacts reusability and demonstrability.
- LLs publishes finalised artefacts.
- LLs advocates for highly granular and configurable artefacts.
- LLs is data-oriented.

LLs must enable:

- Creating, updating, sharing, and deleting resources.
- Accessing and reusing resources from different clients.
- Supporting the demonstration of our projectsâ€™ outputs.
- The standardisation of the projects researchers develop in our group.

The ML@CL website is available [here](https://mlatcl.github.io/). It is a GitHub Pages website whose repository is [here](https://github.com/mlatcl).
